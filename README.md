# FES - Create a UK catch certificate (prototype)

## Introduction
This project was created using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/). The Prototype Kit allows you to quickly create realistic, interactive prototypes of GOV.UK services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 20.11.1)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
- **Developing locally**: The application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`. You can make changes to the code and see them reflected in real-time.
- **Prototyping**: Use the templates and components provided by the GOV.UK Design System to create your prototypes. Refer to the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit documentation](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/) for detailed guidance.
